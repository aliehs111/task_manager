## Description
An application using Python to maintain a running list of tasks.  This program features a CLI in the terminal and basic CRUD functions.  A user must be logged in to see the full menu.  Python regex is used to verify password.
## Installation
Once opening the file, run "python proj2_task_manager.py" in command line and the menu will appear.
## Usage
A new user can create log in credentials and access their own lists of tasks.  They can add tasks, mark them as completed, delete and save them.  As well they can view a list of current tasks.  If they log out, they can log back in to see their tasks and use the program.  A new user can create log in credentials and access their own lists of tasks.  They can add tasks, mark them as completed, delete them and view a list of current tasks.
## Resources
Initially, the functions were developed and tested in google colab notebooks.  As the code cells were ready, they were moved over to VS Code for final .py file.  Watching class videos and researching Python on W3 Schools was helpful to understand how .json files could be used to store the key value pairs and how to implement regex for password management.
## Further Development
This application should have a more professional user interface possibly using a Python library.  More functions like schedules and task due dates, user notifications could be developed.  As the data scales, other plans would need to be made for database management, especially with multiple users.  Perhaps limits of number of tasks stored should be utilized.  There should be a function for a user who forgets their login credentials.
## Testing
Code blocks were tested in a colab notebook by calling the function and passing arguments if applicable and printing the results.  The required sequence of the code was logical thinking through what fuctions needed to be accessed by subsequent ones.  Once all the code was together, using the program and testing as a new user helped understand the program better from the user's perspective and some of the print functions were updated to better communicated with the user.
